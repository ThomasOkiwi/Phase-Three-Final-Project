    "### Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to develop a robust predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning from SyriaTel, our telecommunications company. By understanding and predicting customer churn, we aim to minimize revenue loss and proactively implement retention strategies.\n",

    "3.\tCan customer service interactions serve as early indicators of dissatisfaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scope\n",
    "The scope of this project encompasses the analysis of historical customer data to identify patterns and indicators associated with churn. The focus is on developing a binary classification model that can effectively distinguish between customers likely to churn and those likely to stay.\n",

    "#### Key Stakeholders\n",
    "1.\tTelecom Operations Team:  They are interested in reducing churn as it directly impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.\n",
